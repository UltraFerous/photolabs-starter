# PhotoLabs React Project

PhotoLabs is a simple, single-page Pinterest clone. In this project, the homepage connects to two APIs to display a variety of topics and photos. Users can like photos, which will trigger a notification in the top right, and can open a modal where they can view the high-resolution image and discover similar photos.

The PhotoLabs project for the Web Development React course programming.
